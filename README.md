TEAM CHARTER

Multiple reasons exist for preparing a team charter. One is to document the team's purpose and clearly define individual roles, responsibilities, and operating rules. Next, it establishes procedures for both the team and management/industry partners on communicating, reporting, and decision-making procedures. It lays out a blueprint for conducting business for the acquisition and defines how the team works in an empowered manner, including setting out responsibility and authority. Finally, it facilitates stakeholder buy in by including key members in the decision making process and obtaining their concurrence along the way. 

The charter includes the following sections:

1. Purpose
The purpose of forming the team is not only to cover more ground when it comes to the project, but to use the skills (either combined or separate as the team excels in different aspects in computer programming) that we learned throughout our time in our college program.

In addition, we also plan of going beyond from what we know when it comes to programming as not only we’ll be dealing with the process of making this assignment successful software-wise, but also hardware-wise as well.

2. Background
Since we are making a security system that is based on a certain word that is typed into the system, the demographic we are aiming for is individuals living in homes. Whether they are living in an apartment complex, renting, or have bought a home, etc., anyone who is living under a roof of a house is the perfect candidate for getting this security device. What is special about this project is that it combines both hardware and software materials in order to make this project work efficiently.

3. Scope
Our objective varies in several different ways, but they are connected to each to other overall. First, we have to get the necessary equipment needed for this project. Next, we have to assemble it together both in terms of hardware and software and make them work on command. While the former two is going on, a website must be made in order for customers to have access in ordering the device, or knowing the location of our company.

High-level goals #1: Getting the necessary equipment.
High-level goals #2: Putting the equipment together and making the 
 				  device.
High-level goals #3: Coding in commands and making them work in 
  conjunction with the device.
	
4. Team composition

1.	Ryan Hirmiz: Specializes in website design/web development. Since Ryan has had more experience in HTML/CSS thanks to his experience in graphic design, he will be creating the website for this company. While this aspect of the project is small given how HTML/CSS is one of the easier codes learned throughout this team member’s time, the duration will be a 4-5 weeks long as in addition to working on the website, Ryan will also be helping on the hardware aspect of the project with his other team members in order to not only cover more ground but to also learn/refresh his knowledge on the various code that will be utilized in this project.
2.	Furba Sherpa: Skilled in back-end development. He will be working on the back-end of the website using PHP and MySQL to store and retrieve information from the database and also keep the website secure, helping Ryan complete the website to have it fully functioning and looking professional. Furba will also be working on the hardware and the software aspect of the project with Ryan and Dominic.
3.	Dominic Mandapat: Versatile and fluent in multiple programming language, also experienced in hardware set-up and repair. He will work mainly on the back-end development for the project, and the production of the device along with Furba, making sure that hardware and software will work together. In addition, he will help in developing other aspects of the project such as the design of the system and the overall process of the system.

5. Team empowerment
(Define existing authority the team, by virtue of its individual membership, already possesses, additional authority needed to fully perform as envisioned by the team objectives, and level of empowerment requested.)

6. Team operations
All decisions-making task are done in a meeting or is required to have approval of all three team members so that everybody is on the same page and there are little to no confusions during the life time of the project.

7. Team Performance Assessment
Sprints before the actual making of the product.
